Today we went to a Woodstock homeschool meeting. When we were there there was a lesson on what owl eat and my friend Eva joined in. It was quite smelly and I was not up for it so I just sat next to her, after a while I was bored so I just started taking photos.

Thoughts: It was quite smelly there and I was pretty freaked out! I could not stand the smell!!!
