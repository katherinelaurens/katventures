We visited Mount Etna on the 14th July on a sunny afternoon. This is me on the way to Mount Etna on the coach.

When we got there we used a cable car to get up. The ride up was scary.

Mount Etna is a stratovolcano, that first started to erupt about 500,000 years ago. It frequently erupts, here are two of the dates that it erupted:  Januaryâ€“April 2012, and again in July-October 2012.

Here is a picture of me on Mount Etna holding a truckðŸ™‚

And here is a picture of a box of rocks, including sulphur, wood fossil, granite and lava rock that I bought from the souvenir store.

Sadly their names are in Italian, but you can Google the translations if you want.ðŸ˜¦
